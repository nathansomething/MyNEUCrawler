 Description: Introduces the fundamental ideas of computing and programming principles. Discusses a systematic approach to word problems, including analytic reading, synthesis, goal setting, planning, plan execution, and testing. Presents several models of computing, beginning with functional program design. The latter part of the course consists of two parts: a task organization (ranging from the description of data to the creation of a test suite) and a data-oriented approach to the organization of programs (ranging from atomic data to self-referential data definitions and functions as data). Offers students an opportunity to practice pair programming and public code review techniques, as found in industry today. No prior programming experience is assumed; therefore, suitable for students with little or no computer science background. Prereq. MSCS ALIGN students only.
